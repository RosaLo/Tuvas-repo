Moto Motos Diary: Day 1
Gloria is cute.
Her friend said: "Look at how I think Moto Moto likes you!
She likes me because I can lift an eyebrow without lifting the other one, and that is very sexy.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 2
I gave Gloria a chocolate heart with caffe latte taste. 
She thought it was a very sexy and delicious gift.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 3
I kissed Gloria today. 
She tasted caffe latte from the chocolate heart I gave to her yesterday.
Then we swimmed together in my very big and sexy hot tub.
Gloria said it wasnÂ´t hot enough with just 40 degrees Celsius.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 4
Gloria and I swimmed in the hot tub again.
We peed in the hot tub so that it got warmer.
My cleaner said: "Ew Moto Moto, that is so disgusting!"
Neither me nor Gloria cared.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 5
Today I decided to give Gloria a gift.
It was an exotic, very tropical soft drink that tasted pineapple,mango and orange.
She appreciated it so much that we booked a trip to a "Tropical Vacation Hangout" on Amazon.
It seemed suspicious. We didnt care.
Me and Gloria will go there by Palm Airlines tomorrow night.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 6
The first thing Gloria did when she waked up today was to pack for the vacation.
She was already done with the packing when I woke up.
The reason I woke up so late is that I am lazy.
It is not necessarily something bad - Gloria thinks it is sexy.
We watched tv the whole day today before getting to the airport.
When me and Gloria got to the airport, we waited for ten minutes and then the plane came.
It didnt have a very pleasant smell. 
We found our seats and sat there. The seats were wet and smelled pee.
As if we cared!
Soon, the plane took off. 
3000 meters up in the air the left engine "broke" cause "a bird flew into it".
We turned back to the airport.
Then our flight got cancelled. We got no refund.
Gloria's friend said it was a scam. We didn't care.
