Moto Motos Diary: Day 1
Gloria is cute.
Her friend said: "Look at how I think Moto Moto likes you!
She likes me because I can lift an eyebrow without lifting the other one, and that is very sexy.

I gave Gloria a chocolate heart with caffe latte taste. 
She thought it was a very sexy and delicious gift.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 3
I kissed Gloria today. 
She tasted caffe latte from the chocolate heart I gave to her yesterday.
Then we swimmed together in my very big and sexy hot tub.
Gloria said it wasnÂ´t hot enough with just 40 degrees Celsius.

Gloria and I swimmed in the hot tub again.
We peed in the hot tub so that it got warmer.
My cleaner said: "Ew Moto Moto, that is so disgusting!"
Neither me nor Gloria cared.

Moto Motos Diary: Day 5
Today I decided to give Gloria a gift.
It was an exotic, very tropical soft drink that tasted pineapple,mango and orange.
She appreciated it so much that we booked a trip to a "Tropical Vacation Hangout" on Amazon.
It seemed suspicious. We didnt care.
Me and Gloria will go there by Palm Airlines tomorrow night.
